Traverse through the screen and draw cool stuff 

## Author's Note
This project wasn't as easy as I thought. It took some effort, but I think it's pretty cool. I would really appreciate your vote ðŸ«¶ðŸ¥¹.

## Project Overview
You can draw whatever you like on a simple canvas made out of squares. Just hold the mouse button and hover over the squares of which the canvas is made. You can only have a grid of 100x100 squares at max, otherwise performance issues would likely occur. You can choose between the typical black-white mode or choose the rainbow mode which acts like a magic pen - try it out! You can also reset the canvas or create a new one. It's all up to you!

## Features
- DOM manipulation at a scale
- Dynamically changing opacity
- Buttons change color when hovered over while holding the mouse button
- You can reset the canvas
- Creating a new grid is easy, just press a button!
- A "Rainbow" mode where you can play around with colors!
- And much more...

## Tech Stack
Simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript setup. Nothing crazy, but gets the job done.
